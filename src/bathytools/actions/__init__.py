class Action(ABC):
    """
    The `Action` class represents an operation performed on bathymetry data
    prior to its discretization into a mask.

    The primary functionality of an `Action` is defined by the `__call__`
    method, which modifies the input bathymetry and returns the result.
    From a programmatic perspective, bathymetry data is represented as a
    `DataArray` with the following structure:
      - Two dimensions: latitude and longitude.
      - A single scalar dimension for elevation.

    The elevation values are defined as 0 for land and negative for ocean.

    This is an abstract base class providing a general interface for actions
    and a mechanism to locate specific subclasses by their names.

    A mandatory requirement for all subclasses is that there must be possible
    to initialize them from a dictionary. We will refer to such dictionaries
    as `initialization dictionaries`. The only mandatory field in such a
    dictionary is the `name` field, which specifies the name of the action
    (the name of the class). Even if it is not mandatory, another special
    field is `description`, which contains a human-readable description of the
    reason for performing the action. If the description is not provided, itÃ¹
    will be set to an empty string.
    Moreover, another reserved field is `args`, which contains the
    arguments that must be passed to the action constructor. If not submitted,
    this will be considered as an empty dictionary.
    Other fields are action-specific.

    The `MultipleChoiceAction` class is an extension of the `Action` class that
    allows for multiple operations, with the specific operation determined by an

    is to associate several different Python functions to the same action name.

    A `MultipleChoiceAction` expects the initialization dictionary to have four
    fields:
      - `name` (required): The name of the action, identifying its class.
      - `description` (optional): A human-readable description for the action.
            Defaults to an empty string.
      - `args` (optional): A dictionary containing arguments specific to the
            operation being performed. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
      - `<choice_field>` (required): The name of this field is defined by the
            `get_choice_field` method. The value of this field determines the
            operation to be performed by the action.

    The `get_choice_field` method specifies the name of the additional field
    required in the initialization dictionary.
    The `get_choices` method returns a mapping of values for the
    `<choice_field>` to the corresponding functions implementing the operations.
    In other words, the allowed values for the `<choice_field>` in the
    initialization dictionary are the keys of the mapping returned by the
    `get_choices` method.
    Each value in this mapping, instead, represents a possible function that
    can be called by this action.
    When the `__call__` method of this class is invoked, the class resolves the
    function to execute based on the value of the `<choice_field>` and executes
    it. The resolved function receives the bathymetry data and the arguments
    (`args`) specified in the initialization dictionary.
