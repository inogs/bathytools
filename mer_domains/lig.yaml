actions:
  - action: SetDepth
    description: |
      Set the depth of all the cells that are shallower than 3 meters to exactly
      3 meters. We believe that this should guarantee a better behaviour
      around the coasts.
    where: everywhere
    args:
      value: 3.
      shallower_than: 3.

  - action: SetDepth
    description: |
      Put land on a slice of water cells adjacent to the southern boundary since there
      is land in the cells just above
